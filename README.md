# LineApp leadgen page
Hi there! This is the code for the leadgen page of the physical queue management system. Feel free to use for whatever reasons. I decided to turn this startup idea down because the leadgen didn't get enough traction, but you can try it nevertheless. I would love to see smarter lineup management in the real world.

# Building
I have no idea why it doesn't build, but it uses webpack so you'll figure it out. Just run `yarn install` and then `yarn server`. Which will for some reason fail. Enjoy!
